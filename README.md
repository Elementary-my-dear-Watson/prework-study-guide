#   # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework study guide was created by students to help and study the topics and projects on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaSript.

My motivation is to build this project was for the bootcamp students to have an easy way to recall roundational principles of coding. By doing this it will also help be a guild throughout our coding experiance.
